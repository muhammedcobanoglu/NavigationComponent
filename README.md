# NavigationComponent
There are 3 main parts of a navigation component. 

## Navigation Graph 
It is an XML resource file that includes all navigation-related information. This allows us to manage navigation related tasks from a single location

## NavigationHostFragment
It is an empty container. We keep on the activity to hold navigation graph activity_main.xml

## NavController
It is a class generated by the navigation library to manage the navigation between destinations we added to the navigation
